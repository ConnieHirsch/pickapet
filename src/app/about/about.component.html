    </h1>
    <p>
      This project was generated with
      <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli">Angular CLI</a> version
      6.2.5.
    </p>
    <h2><a id="About_This_Project_4"></a>About This Project</h2>
    <p>
      My aim was to use Angular to create a full-stack web app, to work through
      the ground-up steps of creating an Angular project on my own, and to
      demonstrate my mastery of the platform, using mobile-first design with
      some of the nicer
      <a href="https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home"
        >Bootstrap-adapted-for-Angular</a
      >
      functions. It is a true single page application, using Angular’s routing
      functions to load your screens with a minimum of server-side interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic concept is to provide a showcase website for animals seeking
      adoption (yeah, like Tindr but for adorable animals) that a staff person
      would curate – there is a full set of adoptee and shelter forms that
      interact with a Firebase back end. Currently, the four entries in the app
      are hard-coded in the app as a ‘starter set’ to guard against accidental
      deletion.
    </p>
    <h2><a id="The_Parts_Of_The_Project_10"></a>The Parts Of The Project</h2>
    <h3><a id="Splash_Screen__Main_Tab_12"></a>Splash Screen / Main Tab</h3>
    <p>
      The entry screen for this app, featuring a carousel that gives you basic
      adoptee information – a picture, a name, where they are available, and
      depending on the size of your screen, the start of the entry description.
      To find out more, you click on the <em>Learn More</em> button.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carousel feature is powered by Angular. Behind the scenes on the
      browser side, the data for the carousel is a JSON object shared between
      Angular modules.
    </p>
    <h3><a id="Header_18"></a>Header</h3>
    <p>
      Collapses to a standard Hamburger icon for smaller screens. Note the
      dropdown functionality for the <em>Manage</em> function. Code uses
      Angular’s <em>router.navigate()</em> functionality to switch screens with
      low overhead.
    </p>
    <h3><a id="Adoptees_Tab_22"></a>Adoptees Tab and Page</h3>
    <p>
      Here you see the featured pet that you have clicked on, or the complete
      list of pets available, with the ability to read in full any description,
      plus basic facts about them – breed, age and so on. The entries could be
      easily made more elaborate with additional fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have an Admin role, you will be able to create, edit or delete pet
      entries, including being able to draw shelter name and URL from the
      Shelter listing, so you can only add entries from existing (permitted)
      shelters.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <a id="Adoptees_Detail_Launch_your_next_step_button_28"></a>Adoptees
      Detail 'Launch your next step!&quot; Button
    </h3>
    <p>
      This launches a modal screen (Bootstrap via Angular) that asks if you
      really want to investigate the adoptable pet further, and in a
      <em>working</em> version of the app would take you to the actual shelter
      entry of the pet you’ve chosen to further pursue adoption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this is just a <em>demo</em>, all the links I’ve supplied go to a
      <em>demo</em> page on my own website, so you get the idea without
      bothering anyone out in the real world of pet adoption.
    </p>
    <h3><a id="Shelters_34"></a>Shelters Tab and Page</h3>
    <p>
      As with the Adoptee page, it is just a listing of shelter entries, and
      also only the administrator will be able to create, update and delete
      entries – ideally it would be shelters that have agreed to have adoptable
      pets featured in this app, or perhaps each shelter would curate its own
      entries.
    </p>
    <h3><a id="About_39"></a>About Tab and Page</h3>
    <p>
      Every website needs to have an About/Contact! Pretend for now it's
      explaining how the pets are carefully curated, hand-selected from the
      freshest boutique shelters and rescue groups, et cetera -- meanwhile, I'm
      repeating the markdown explanation about this site, which seems to be a
      useful thing to do.
    </p>

    <h3><a id="Scroll_To_Top_Button_0"></a>Scroll To Top Button</h3>
    <p>
      For long pages (especially small screens) it seemed necessary to have a To
      Top button appear when the user is far enough down the page to need it. I
      was able to adapt a lovely example
      <a
        href="https://medium.com/@appl4e/scroll-to-top-button-for-angular-99ddeebb8c3a"
      >
        ‘Scroll to top Button for Angular’</a
      >
      presented on Medium by Apple Mahmood.
    </p>

    <h3><a id="Manage_43"></a>Manage Tab</h3>
    <p>
      If you really want to explore this (and if you’ve read this far, you may
      as well) the ID and password are
      <strong>test@test.com</strong> and <strong>password</strong>. (I just
      wanted to make it easy for testing – the data this accesses is junk data
      for testing only.) You can then <strong>Fetch Data</strong>, edit the
      fetched data on the relevant pages (note that editing function buttons are
      now available both for Adoptees and Shelters),
      <strong>Save Data</strong> and then <strong>Logout</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firebase is the current backend database, since I had recent experience
      using it, but any database such as MySQL or MongoDB would be easily linked
      instead. But since, this is a demo, it was nice to get some practice in
      with Firebase.
    </p>
    <h3><a id="Footer_49"></a>Footer</h3>
    <p>
      It’s a footer, but I got to link in some of the Font Awesome glyphs and
      make them play nicely with the Angular code.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a id="What_I_Learned_With_This_Project_53"></a>What I Learned With This
      Project
    </h2>
    <p>
      I got to take an Angular project from the first setup command to creating
      modules, to sharing services between those modules, routing, CRUD
      interactions, CSS styling that overrides Angular’s base CSS, put in screen
      size reactivity, and produced an app that runs mobile-first but expands
      gracefully for the bigger screens. And while occasionally I got frustrated
      with a detail or two, I was able to figure out where I’d gone wrong and
      largely enjoy making it.
